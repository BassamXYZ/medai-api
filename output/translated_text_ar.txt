The Arabic phrase "ما هو مرض السكري" translates to "What is diabetes?" in English.  This is a straightforward question about the disease, and doesn't include descriptions of symptoms or patient complaints.  To provide a more complete answer that addresses the prompt's request for symptom details, a more comprehensive Arabic text would be needed. For instance,  a patient might present with symptoms and ask  "ما هو مرض السكري وما هي أعراضه؟" (What is diabetes and what are its symptoms?).  Then, a more detailed translation encompassing symptoms (e.g., excessive thirst (عطش شديد), frequent urination (تكرر التبول), unexplained weight loss (فقدان الوزن غير المبرر), increased hunger (زيادة الشهية), blurred vision (عدم وضوح الرؤية), slow-healing sores (قروح بطيئة الالتئام), etc.) would be necessary.  The current phrase only requests a definition of the disease itself.
