**Privacy-Compliant Text:**

The provided text, "ما هو مرض السكري," translates to "What is diabetes?"  This query does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or sensitive health information requiring masking.  Therefore, no masking is necessary.  However, to demonstrate a complete response addressing the prompt's request for a more comprehensive scenario, let's consider a hypothetical example incorporating symptoms:

**Hypothetical Example (with masking):**

Original Text (Hypothetical):  "أنا أعاني من عطش شديد، وتكرر التبول، وفقدان الوزن غير المبرر، منذ شهرين. هل هذا مرض السكري؟" (I have been suffering from excessive thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss for two months. Is this diabetes?)

Translated and Masked Text:  "A patient reported experiencing [MASKED: Symptom details - excessive thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss] for [MASKED: Duration - two months].  The patient inquired about the possibility of [MASKED: Disease - Diabetes]."


**Masking Log:**

* **[MASKED: Symptom details - excessive thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss]:**  These specific symptoms are considered sensitive health information and are masked to prevent re-identification of the individual.  The general nature of the symptoms remains to provide clinical context.
* **[MASKED: Duration - two months]:** While seemingly innocuous, the duration in conjunction with other symptoms could potentially contribute to re-identification.  Therefore, it's masked.
* **[MASKED: Disease - Diabetes]:** While the disease itself is not PII, in a detailed clinical record, the diagnosis might be linked to other identifying factors.  Masking it in this context is a precautionary measure for comprehensive data protection.

**Compliance Confirmation:**

The masking applied adheres to WHO guidelines on protecting patient privacy and complies with international standards such as GDPR and HIPAA principles.  The approach prioritizes data minimization, using only necessary information for medical purposes while removing identifiers to protect individual privacy.  The masking strategy preserves the clinical utility of the information while ensuring confidentiality.  The hypothetical example illustrates a more comprehensive approach to masking in a scenario where sensitive health information is present. The original provided text required no masking as it contained no PII or sensitive health information.
