To obtain a complete medical history and accurately assess the possibility of diabetes, the following questions are necessary, categorized for clarity:


**I. Primary Symptoms:**

1. **Describe your thirst:**  How intense is your thirst?  Is it constant or intermittent? Does drinking large amounts of water relieve it only temporarily?  When did this excessive thirst begin? (This helps establish symptom onset and severity, crucial for diagnosis and differentiating from other conditions).

2. **Describe your urination:** How often do you urinate, especially at night? What is the volume of your urine each time? Is your urine unusually pale or clear? (Frequency, volume, and color are key indicators of fluid balance disturbances often associated with diabetes).

3. **Describe any weight changes:** How much weight have you gained or lost? Over what period of time? Was this weight change intentional or unintentional?  (Unexplained weight loss is a significant symptom of uncontrolled diabetes).

4. **Describe your hunger:** Do you feel excessively hungry, even after eating?  How often do you feel the need to eat? (Increased hunger, despite adequate food intake, is a hallmark of diabetes due to impaired glucose utilization).

5. **Describe your vision:** Have you experienced any changes in your vision, such as blurred vision?  When did this begin? (Blurred vision is a common complication of diabetes due to high blood sugar affecting the eyes).

6. **Describe any skin changes:** Have you noticed any slow-healing sores, cuts, or infections?  Where are these located? (Slow-healing wounds are a sign of impaired circulation and immune function, common in diabetics).

7. **Describe any other symptoms:** Are you experiencing any other symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, numbness or tingling in your extremities, frequent infections, or any other concerning symptoms? (Fatigue, weakness, and increased susceptibility to infections are common in diabetes).


**II. Onset and Progression:**

8. **When did these symptoms begin?** (Pinpointing the onset helps determine the disease duration and progression).

9. **Have the symptoms been constant, or have they fluctuated in severity?** (Fluctuations may indicate poorly controlled diabetes or other underlying factors).

10. **Have you noticed any patterns associated with the symptoms?** (For example, are symptoms worse after eating certain foods or at specific times of the day?)


**III. Related Symptoms:**

11. **Do you experience any other health problems?** (Comorbidities can influence diabetes management and prognosis).

12. **Have you experienced any recent illnesses or infections?** (Infections can exacerbate diabetes and complicate diagnosis).


**IV. Medical History:**

13. **Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?** (Previous diagnoses can be risk factors for diabetes or impact treatment).

14. **Have you ever had any tests done for diabetes or glucose levels?**  If so, what were the results? (Previous test results provide valuable baseline data).


**V. Medications:**

15. **What medications are you currently taking (prescription, over-the-counter, herbal remedies)?** (Medications can interact with diabetes treatments or mask symptoms).


**VI. Allergies:**

16. **Do you have any allergies to medications or other substances?** (Allergies are crucial for safe medication selection).


**VII. Family History:**

17. **Does anyone in your immediate family (parents, siblings, children) have diabetes or a history of diabetes?** (Family history significantly increases the risk of developing diabetes).


**VIII. Lifestyle Factors:**

18. **Can you describe your diet?** (Dietary habits are essential for diabetes management and prevention).

19. **How much physical activity do you get on a regular basis?** (Physical activity is crucial for managing blood sugar levels).

20. **Do you smoke? If so, how much?** (Smoking is a major risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular complications).

21. **Do you consume alcohol? If so, how much and how often?** (Alcohol consumption can affect blood sugar control).

22. **What is your current weight and height?** (BMI is a crucial factor in assessing diabetes risk and overall health).


**Critical Missing Information:**

The initial query, "What is diabetes?", lacks crucial information regarding the patient's symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle.  This gap prevents any accurate assessment of the possibility of diabetes.  Gathering the information outlined above is essential for a proper diagnosis.  A physical examination and laboratory tests (fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, etc.) are also needed for confirmation.
